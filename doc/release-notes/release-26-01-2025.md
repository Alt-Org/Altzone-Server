### Endpoint for getting items of player's clan

Endpoint for retrieving items of the clan where the logged-in player is a member. Returned items are separated into two arrays for stock and soul home items.

### Endpoint for getting clan position on the leaderboard

_/leaderboard/clan/position_ GET

### `clanLogo` field added to the clan data

New field `clanLogo` is added to the clan data. The `clanLogo` field is meant to be used to store data of the customized by players clan logos.

The logo of a clan consists of various pieces that can be colored by players into any color, which can be represented by hexadecimal notation (i.e. #FFFFFF)

Here is the structure of the `clanLogo` field:

```ts
...
clanLogo: {
  logoType: "Heart", //Currently it can be only of type "Heart"
  pieceColors: [ // array of hexadecimal colors
    "#FFFFFF",
    "#000000",
    ...      
  ]
}
...
```
